# Premier-League-Database

For this project MySQL Workbench was used to generate the database. Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 was used as the IDE, and can be downloaded using the following
link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/

When downloading Visual Studio, be sure to download the .NET extension, allowing you to program in C#, which is the programming language used for this project. 

Also make sure to download the Microsoft .NET/Connect database connectivity software, which is used to connect to the MySQL database from visual studio. The link for this installation is provided here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/8.0.html

Once you have intalled MySQL Workbench and all the coresponding packages with it, open a new query script and paste in the SQL script provided in this repository. Once you do that, the pldata database should be created. After creating the database, make sure you have the windows form app package downloaded for C# in Visual Studio; this will serve as the GUI. Then you can paste all the code into Visual Studio and the program will be created.
